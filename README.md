# Payfren (1st place at [Hardcore Entrepreneur Hackathon 2.0](https://punctulit.club/))

---

**Payfren** is an app that makes it easy to pay your friends in Bitcoin, replacing the old system of long addresses with user friendly names.

---

The app needs to be connected to an [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) instance that has documents configured as the models that are defined in `lib/models`
and which is publicly hosted and accessible via a domain name. Appwrite Buckets can be used for user profile photos.

Sign-up button has not been implemented.

All configuration must be done in the `lib/config.dart`.
